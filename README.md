This repo is a complete set of tools to create a game where you can explore and relate to characters. 

In order to simplify the update work and avoid errors in saving I created functions that check the correct state of variables by inserting them in after_load 
(e.g. after a change to a quest that causes a stage to be blocked, the quest should restart) and an abundant use of define.

For the time being, a good part of the screens and images are not of my creation and terminology, and the comments need to be revised.
